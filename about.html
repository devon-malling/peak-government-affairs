            <h1 class="about-page-header">Discover a new level in government relations.</h1>
            <p class="about-page-p">Solomon Malick, President and CEO of Peak Government Affairs (PGA), started his career as a contract lobbyist at his father’s firm, CNM Enterprises Inc. in early 2005. As an associate at CNM, Solomon represented a variety of sectors including small business, education, renewable energy, mental health and infrastructure.  Specifically, Solomon has successfully lobbied to reform aspects of Colorado’s education system, improve renewable energy standards in the state, protect small business interests and improve living and care standards for Coloradans living with mental health conditions.  Upon his father’s retirement in 2013, Solomon founded Peak Government Affairs where he continues to aggressively advocate for his clients’ interests through the legislative and regulatory process.</p>
            <p class="about-page-p">Over ten years of lobbying in Colorado, Mr. Malick’s successes have been based on several basic principles:</p>
            <li class="about-page-p">strong vote counting and support from 	client expertise, grassroots and media, create the best avenue for executing legislative solutions and maintaining a consistently growing profile for the client.
            </li>
            <li class="about-page-p">advance building of coalitions and stakeholder partnerships form the most effective foundation for success.
            </li>
            <li class="about-page-p">
               spreading the political net as wide as possible makes issue viability more realistic and attainable
            </li>
            <p class="about-page-p">Solomon created PGA to continue his work in giving a voice to important issues at the Colorado State Capitol.  He has worked tirelessly to build relationships on both sides of the aisle, within the Governor’s office, and with his peers in the lobby. He also understands the importance creating relationships with stakeholders, a process unique to each individual issue. When working with stakeholders and coalitions, Mr. Malick not only strives to understand the client’s issue and position nuances, but also to understand the same for all parties involved, including those opposed to his client’s position. A comprehensive appreciation for all angles of an issue dynamic, afford insights that prove integral for success.  Forging important relationships and an understanding of stakeholder perspectives have allowed him grow his client profiles, and most importantly, to achieve legislative and regulatory wins on their behalf.
            </p>
            <p class="about-page-p">Prior to his lobbying career, Solomon attended Colorado State University and pursued a career in emergency medicine and wild land fire suppression with the United States Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior.  He currently lives in Englewood, Colorado with his wife Dana.
