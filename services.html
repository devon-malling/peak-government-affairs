               <h2 class="services-headers">Initiative and Legislative Campaign Strategy Creation and Implementation</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">This is where all political agendas start and finish. From policy inception, to The Governor's signature, our strategy is a living, breathing animal that needs constant attention and revision. Preparation, improvisation, and adaptation are paramount components for running an effective, well organized political venture.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Legislative Monitoring</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">A sharp eye makes sure nothing falls through the cracks and is a large part of having a finger on the pulse of Colorado's State Capitol. Information is power, and having good information galvanizes that power. There are over 600 bills introduced every year, so PGA stays vigilant everyday making sure nothing that could affect you, even indirectly, goes unnoticed and unreported.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Coalition Building</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">A well recruited team is a major key to success in Colorado's political world. Knowing who to approach and who not to is a very important step in a forming a winning lineup. PGA views every coalition building effort on a case by case basis because every legislative push is unique by nature.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Timing Evaluation</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Timing plays a vital role in every decision related to all legislative campaigns. PGA's expertise and experience dictates how and when to use certain tactics, making sure our clients' interests are adequately protected.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Power Web Creation and Maintenance</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">This is a top to bottom approach that incorporates every governmental player in the state; from local governments, to the legislature, to The Governors office. The power web needs to include relevant stakeholders that directly or indirectly aid in our efforts. This is different than coalition building in that these relationships are long term, not contingent on an issue to issue basis.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Political Consulting</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Political consulting is a large part of what Peak Government Affairs does as a lobbying firm. Knowing the political landscape and excelling at decoding the formula in a way that forms good strategy, is essential to running an effective legislative campaign. There is usually one desired result for each campaign, with a million ways to get to that goal. PGA evaluates each probable outcome, and helps guide the clients' strategy while keeping their policy goals at the forefront to lead them down the road to ultimate success.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Active Lobbying</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">A relatively straight forward process, this is where the rubber hits the road and we find out where we actually stand with our effort. Where the votes end up decides the rest of our strategy as we move forward through both chambers and on to The Governor's desk. Peak Government Affairs is known for its effective and reliable vote counting techniques and results.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Elected Official and Administration Relationship Building</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Politics is about people, so without healthy and productive relationships, success is a very difficult goal to achieve. PGA works hard to garner those relationships by using mutual respect and understanding as a catalyst to make all ships rise, including the ships of elected and appointed officials.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Bill Drafting</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Where your policy ideas materialize into the language that will ultimately fit into Colorado Revised Statutes. Peak Government Affairs works with Capitol staff attorneys who specialize in specific policy areas to make sure our clients' policy ideas are reflected sufficiently in the draft language. This language will eventually end up as a bill that runs through the legislature and hopefully ends up as concrete, prescriptive law.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Legislative Committee, Executive Board, and Membership Meeting Attendance and Presentation</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Peak Government Affairs recognizes that the key to a successful client/lobbyist relationship is an uninhibited communication flow. Knowing the client's wants and needs is the most important role a lobbyist can play. Peak Government Affairs does not work for the legislature or The Governor, we work for our clients. Our job is to make sure the client's policy priorities are addressed while taking our political expertise into account and forming our strategy around political realities.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Proactive Legislation</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Peak Government Affairs runs legislation, and we are good at it. This requires massive amounts of strategy and policy formation, political understanding, legislative process intimacy, deep relationship foundations with elected and appointed officials, and a sound perspective on the inner workings of the legislative mechanism. Passing a bill is always the primary goal, but it is not always guaranteed depending on the make up of the legislature, The Governors office, and the issue under consideration. In that case, we need to be winning even if we don't achieve our proactive goal. This can be done in a number of specific ways which tend to be on a case by case scenario. The worst thing that can happen is to introduce a bill, lose the bill, and hurt our overall agenda by not being able to show anything for our effort. Peak Government Affairs will not let this occur.</p>
               <h2 class="services-headers">Defense Strategy and Active Lobbying</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Defeating legislation is exponentially easier than passing a bill, but it does not mean that every bill can be defeated. Damaging legislation can usually be beaten as long as tangible negative impacts can be identified and iterated succinctly to the legislature and Governor's office. Negative messaging necessary for opposition success needs to come from the client or the client's membership in order to be legitimate and appealing.</p>
