		<div class="services-info">
			<h2 class="services-headers">Initiative and Legislative Campaign Strategy</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">This is where all proactive initiatives and legislation starts and finishes. From policy inception to governor signature, our strategy is a living, breathing beast that needs constant attention and revisitation. Preparation, improvisation and adaptation is paramount for running an effective, well organized effort. </p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Legislative Monitoring</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">A sharp eye making sure nothing falls through the cracks is a large part of having a good idea of what's happening at the Capitol. Information is power and having good information galvanizes that power.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Coalition building</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">A well recruited team is a major key to success in the political world so know who to approach and who not to is a very important step.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Timing Evaluation</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">Timing plays a role in every decision regarding proactive and opposition legislative campaigns. Knowing when to apply pressure and when not to is key when deciding our strategy progression.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Power web creation and maintenance</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">This is a top to bottom approach that incorporates every governmental player in the state from local governments to the legislature to The Governors office. The power web also needs to include relevant stakeholders that can directly or indirectly aid in our efforts. This is different than coalition building in that these relationships are long term, not existing on an issue to issue basis.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Political consulting and surveillance</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">Political consulting is a large part of what Peak Government Affairs does as a lobbying firm. Knowing the political landscape and being able to decode the formula in a way that forms good strategy is essential to running an effective legislative campaign.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Active lobbying (counting votes)</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">A relatively straight forward process, this is where the rubber hits the road and we find out where we actually stand with our effort. Where the votes end up dictates the rest of our strategy as we move forward through both chambers and on to The Governor's desk. Peak Government Affairs is known for its effective and reliable voting counting strategy and results.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Elected official and administration relationship building</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">Politics is about people so without healthy and productive relationships success is a very difficult goal to obtain. Peak Government Affairs works hard to garner those relationships by using mutual respect and understanding as the catalyst to make all ships rise, including the elected and appointed officials.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Bill drafting</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">This is where our policy idea materializes into the language that will ultimately fit into Colorado Revised Statutes. Peak Government Affairs works with the Capitol staff attorneys who specialize in certain policy areas to make sure our client's policy ideas are reflected adequately in the draft language. This language will eventually end up as a bill that runs through the legislature and hopefully ends up as tight and prescriptive law.</p>
			<h2 class="services-headers">Legislative committee, executive board, and membership meeting attendance and presentation</h2>
			<p class="services-paragraphs">Peak Government Affairs recognizes that the key to a successful client/lobbyist relationship is an uninhibited communication flow. Knowing the client's wants and needs is the most important role a lobbyist can play. Peak Government Affairs does not work for the legislature or The Governor, we work for our clients. Our job is to make sure the client's wants and needs are addressed while taking our political expertise into account and forming our strategy around political realities.</p>
