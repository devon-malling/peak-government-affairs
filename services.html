               <p class="services-paragraphs">
                  This is an advocacy agenda, start and finish. From policy inception, to The Governor's signature, to implementation, our strategy is a living, breathing creature that needs constant attention and revision. Preparation, improvisation, and adaptation are paramount components for running an effective, well organized campaign venture.

                  Coalition Building- A well recruited team is a major key to success in Colorado's political world. Knowing who to approach and who not to is a very important step in forming a winning lineup. PGA views every coalition building effort on a case by case basis because every legislative push is unique by nature.
               </li>
               
               <li class="about-page-p">
                  Creating the power web: This is a top to bottom approach that incorporates every governmental player in the state; from local governments, to the legislature, to The Governor's office. The power web needs to include relevant stakeholders that directly or indirectly aid in our efforts. This is different than coalition building in that these relationships are long term, not contingent on an issue to issue basis.
               </li>
               
               <li class="about-page-p">
                  Relationship Building with Elected Officials: Politics is about people, so without healthy and productive relationships, success is a very difficult goal to achieve. PGA works hard to garner those relationships by using mutual respect and understanding as a catalyst to make all ships rise, including the ships of elected and appointed officials.
               </li>
               
               <li class="about-page-p">
                  Bill Drafting: The stage at which your policy ideas materialize into the language that will ultimately fit into Colorado Revised Statutes. Peak Government Affairs works with Capitol staff attorneys who specialize in specific policy areas to make sure our clients' policy ideas are reflected sufficiently in the draft language. This language will eventually end up as a bill that runs through the legislature and hopefully ends up as concrete, prescriptive law.
               </li>

               <li class="about-page-p">
                  Attendance at Internal Client Meetings: Peak Government Affairs recognizes that the key to a successful client/lobbyist relationship is an uninhibited communication flow. Knowing the client's wants and needs is the most important role a lobbyist can play.  As your representative at the State Capitol, PGA will be an active attendee and participant at client legislative committees, executive board meetings, and membership meetings.  This participation ensures our complete understanding of client ideas and direction. Peak Government Affairs does not work for the legislature or The Governor, we work for our clients. Our job is to make sure the client's policy priorities are addressed while taking our political expertise into account and forming our strategy around political realities.
               </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="services-headers">Proactive Legislation</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">Peak Government Affairs runs legislation, and we are good at it. This requires smart strategy and policy formation, understanding of the political landscape, intimacy with the legislative process, and deep relationship foundations with elected and appointed officials.  This process also requires strong vote counting: where the rubber hits the road.  Where the votes end up determines the rest of our strategy as we move forward through both chambers and on to The Governor's desk. Peak Government Affairs is known for its effective and reliable vote counting techniques and results.</p>

               <h2 class="services-headers">Defense Strategy and Active Lobbying</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">PGA can also lead efforts to defeat legislative or regulatory initiatives harmful to our clientsâ€™ interests and agenda. Damaging legislation can be beaten when the tangible negative impacts can be identified and iterated succinctly to the legislature and Governor's office. Messaging necessary for opposition success is most effective when voiced from the client or the client's membership, with a diligent vote count to ensure the message was properly received by elected officials.</p>
               
               <h2 class="services-headers">Legislative Monitoring</h2>
               <p class="services-paragraphs">
                  A sharp eye makes sure nothing falls through the cracks and is a large part of having a finger on the pulse of Colorado's State Capitol. Information is power, and having good information galvanizes that power. There are over 600 bills introduced every year, so PGA stays vigilant everyday making sure nothing that could affect you, even indirectly, goes unnoticed and unreported.
